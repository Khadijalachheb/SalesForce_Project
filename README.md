## Project Description:

- A client already had the platform Salesforce but this platform does not work well.
- And then a new platform was developed that works well,no crashes or security issues.
- The problem is that the first platform contains all the data necessary for the new platform to be useful.
- So  I had to connect the two platforms using Connected App, AuthProvider and named credentials .
- And after that I use Rest API, Apex, and lightning web components to create interfaces used by administrators to migrate all data needed.
